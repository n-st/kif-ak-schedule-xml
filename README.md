AK Plan as schedule.xml
=======================

Converts the KIF AK plan to the widely-used **`schedule.xml`** format,
understood by (e.g.) **Giggity** ([Google
Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gaast.giggity),
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/net.gaast.giggity/)).  
This allows you to view your AKs in a mobile-optimized view, mark your
favourites, and get reminded in time before they start.

Usage
-----

Tap the `+` button on the Giggity main screen and enter the URL:  
http://kif500.tmp.voidptr.de/schedule.xml  
(sorry, no HTTPS at the momentâ€¦)

The schedule file is updated every 5 minutes.
